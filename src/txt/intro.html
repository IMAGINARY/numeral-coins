<h4>Numeral Systems</h4>
<p>
  A <i>numeral system</i> is a method to write numbers. In contrast with ancient
  systems such as Roman numerals, today we use a positional system. When we
  write "eleven" as 11, we repeat the symbol "1" twice. The first "1" means ten,
  and the second "1" means one, for ten plus one makes eleven.
</p>

<p>
  Our usual positional system uses base 10, the decimal system. This means that
  the last digit represents itself, the next-to-last digit represent itself
  times 10, the next one is multiplied by 100, the next one by 1000, and so on
  with powers of 10.

<h4>Using coins</h4>
<p>
  Imagine we used a currency unit called Gold, and the available coins were 1
  gold, 10 golds, 100 golds, etc.If we want to buy an item that costs, for
  instance, 135 golds, we could pay with 135 pieces of 1 gold. We could also pay
  with one piece of 10 golds and 125 pieces of 1 gold, or 1 piece of 100 golds
  and 35 pieces of 1 gold, or many other combinations. The combination that uses
  the least amount of coins, which is also the one that uses as higher values as
  possible, would be 1 coin of 100, 3 coins of 10, and 5 coins of 1. This is
  because 1 3 5 is the decimal representation of 135.
</p>

<p>
  But now imagine that the coins come available as 1 gold, 4 golds, 16 golds, 64
  golds, etc, as powers of 4. We could still pay with 135 coins of 1 gold, but
  also we could pay with 33 coins of 4 golds and 3 coins of 1 gold, because 135
  = 33 &times 4 + 3. We could also pay with 2 coins of 64 golds, 1 coin of 4
  golds, and 3 coins of 1 gold, since 135 = 2 &times 64 + 1 &times 4 + 3 &times
  1, and this is the way with the least coins. We say that 2 0 1 3 is the base-4
  representation of 135.

<h4>Find your number in base b</h4>
<p>
  To find the base-b representation of a number, you can proceed bottom-up as
  follows: Place as many coins of value 1 as necessary to reach your number.
  Then convert as many coins as possible to higher values. When no more
  conversions are possible, you have reached the base-b representation.
</p>

<p>
  Alternatively, you can proceed top-down as follows: Pick the coin of highest
  value possible without exceeding your number. Keep adding coins, always with
  the highest possible value but such that the sum of your picked coins does not
  exceed your target number. Eventually you will reach your base-b
  representation.

<h4>Using this app</h4>
<p>
  With this app, you can play to find the representation of a goal number (the
  price of the item) in different bases.

  The basic mode (magnifying glass) will guide you through several predefined
  items to buy. The advanced mode (microscope) will propose you random numbers,
  and the end result will be more detailed.
