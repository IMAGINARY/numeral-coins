<h4>3D prints</h4>

<p>
  An analogic version of this activity can be carried out with physical coins.
  We provide here STL files to 3D-print some special coins for numeral systems
  in bases 2, 3, 5, and 10. The coins have a number of sides equal to the base,
  and a face value equal to powers of the base.
